                <h1>About VIVcoin</h1>
                <p>Vivcoin is a virtual currency that aims to solve the essential needs of human beings, food and housing. Owning <span>1000 VIVcoin</span> for a period of 1 year will generate a <strong>DVIV</strong>, which will ensure the right to stay for one night for one person in any of the available places of the partner hotel units or an All Inclusive menu with 3 meals for one person for a day.</p>
                <p>The investments attracted by the financing of these currencies will materialize in the construction of energy independent accommodation spaces. Thus, the newly built buildings will have their own sources of energy production and greenhouses for food production.</p>
